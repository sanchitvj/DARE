## Purpose

This repository serves as a testing ground for:
- **Data Storage Solutions**: Iceberg, Delta Lake, object storage (S3, R2)
- **Query Engines**: Spark, DuckDB, Polars performance comparisons
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Cloudflare R2, multi-cloud architectures
- **ETL/ELT Patterns**: Cross-language performance benchmarking
- **Data Migration**: Between different storage and catalog systems


## Quick Start

Each experiment directory contains its own implementation with specific setup instructions. Focus areas include:

- **Reproducibility**: All experiments include clear setup and execution steps
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmarking data and cost analysis included
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Practical use cases rather than toy examples

## Key Focus Areas

- Cost-effective cloud storage strategies
- Query performance optimization
- Operational overhead analysis
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
